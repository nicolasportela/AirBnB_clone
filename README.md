## AirBnB clone
This project aims to deploy on our server a simple copy of the AirBnB website. We wonâ€™t implement all the features, only some of them to cover all fundamental concepts of the higher level programming track.

At the end, we will have a complete web application composed by:

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell
* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
* A database or files that store data
* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and our data
